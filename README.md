InstaFake Chrome Web App
========================

Sample app hack put together from samples to make instagram-like filters for local images. 
The idea behind the app is that a user selects files from the local file system or drags into the app and then selects a filter to apply.
Modified file can then be saved back to the file system.

Best part is that app is available entirely offline. Online features not supported at the moment.
